    `I began learning web dev using FreeCodeCamp's curriculum, and one of the
    very fist things they have you do is create a portfolio site (<a
    href="https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/pen/YqLyXB"
    target="_blank">example</a>).  I passed up that assignment and finished
    nearly the entire curriculum before putting much thought into making my own
    because I wanted to know everything possible before I started it, I needed
    to have the heavens open up in praise when I pushed it to production. And
    that's how I ended up not having a portfolio for a year. Oops. One of the
    most valuable things I've learned recently is the idea of making a Minimum
    Viable Product instead of trying to perfect everything about a project on
    the first pass, so I'm constantly polishing.`,

    `At the end of this project I wanted to feel like I'd really wrapped my head
    around all of the most common tools in the React workflow, so I learned some
    React Router and Redux then used the wonderful boilerplate <a
    href="https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit#features"
    target="_blank"> React Redux Starter Kit</a> which had me learn some Koa,
    testing tools, and CSS Modules besides.`,

    `If you like the crazy flying text that I use for the menu and titles on
    this site, you can play with the code on CodePen <a
    href="http://codepen.io/MityaDSCH/pen/pbapwN" target="_blank">here</a>.
    Maybe I went a bit overboard with it on this site (when you have a
    hammer...), but I think it's really fun and it was even featured on
    CodePen's front page!`
