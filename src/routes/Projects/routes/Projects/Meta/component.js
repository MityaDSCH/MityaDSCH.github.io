    `I began learning web dev using FreeCodeCamp's curriculum, and one of the
    very fist things they have you do is create a portfolio site (<a
    href="https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/pen/YqLyXB">example</a>).  I passed up
    that assignment and finished nearly the entire curriculum before putting
    much thought into making my own because I wanted to know everything possible
    before I started it, I needed to have the heavens open up in praise when I
    pushed it to production. And that's how I ended up not having a portfolio
    for a year. Oops. One of the most valuable things I've learned recently is
    the idea of making a Minimum Viable Product instead of trying to perfect
    everything about a project on the first pass. So here we are, warts and all
    (looking at you (with great resentment) IE), but I'm constantly polishing.`,

    `At the end of this project I wanted to feel like I'd really wrapped my head
    around all of the most common tools in the React workflow, so I learned some
    React Router and Redux then used the wonderful boilerplate <a
    href="https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit#features"> React
    Redux Starter Kit</a> which had me learn some Koa, testing tools, and CSS
    Modules besides.`
