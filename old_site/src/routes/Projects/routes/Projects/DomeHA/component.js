    `
      I was hired as an independent contractor to write most of the custom
      code on the launch website for the IOT startup Dome. In addition
      to writing HTML/(S)CSS/JS, I planned out and implemented all of
      the schemas that power the CMS. In fact, Dome required so much
      customization of the site that most of the content on the site
      is controlled through a non-native Shopify backend.
